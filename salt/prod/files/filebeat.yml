###################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only the most common
# options. The filebeat.full.yml file from the same directory contains all the
# supported options with more comments. You can use it as a reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html

#=========================== Filebeat prospectors =============================

filebeat.prospectors:

# Each - is a prospector. Most options can be set at the prospector level, so
# you can use different prospectors for various configurations.
# Below are the prospector specific configurations.

#- input_type: log

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
#  paths:
#     - /data/wwwlogs/*/*.log
#  document_type: yg_weba

- input_type: log
  paths:
     - /var/log/secure
  document_type: yg_secure

- input_type: log
  paths:
     - /var/log/messages
  document_type: yg_messages


    # - /var/log/*.log
  #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

  # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list.
  #exclude_lines: ["^DBG"]

  # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list.
  #include_lines: ["^ERR", "^WARN"]

  # Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
  # are matching any regular expression from the list. By default, no files are dropped.
  #exclude_files: [".gz$"]

  # Optional additional fields. These field can be freely picked
  # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
fields:
  cname: yg_etl_06
fields_under_root: true
   # level: debug
  #  review: 1

  ### Multiline options

  # Mutiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
  # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

  # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
  #multiline.pattern: ^\[

  # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
  #multiline.negate: false

  # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
  # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
  # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
  #multiline.match: after


#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
#output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
 # hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"
  #username: "elastic"

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]
#===============================redis======================================
#output.redis:
#  enabled: true
#  hosts: ["172.16.8.167:6379"]

   enabled: true
   hosts: ["172.16.208.51:19092","172.16.208.52:19092"] 
   topic: '%{[type]}'




#================================= Paths ======================================

# The home path for the filebeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all other path settings and for miscellaneous files that come with the
# distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
path.home: /usr/local/filebeat

# The configuration path for the filebeat installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the filebeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which filebeat needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
path.data: /usr/local/filebeat/data

# The logs path for a filebeat installation. This is the default location for
# the Beat's log files. If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file,
# the default for the logs path is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.
path.logs: /usr/local/filebeat/logs

#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag.
#dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#dashboards.url:

# The directory from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead of the URL
# when it has a value.
#dashboards.directory:

# The file archive (zip file) from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead
# of the URL when it has a value.
#dashboards.file:

# If this option is enabled, the snapshot URL is used instead of the default URL.
#dashboards.snapshot: false

# The URL from where to download the snapshot version of the dashboards. By default
# this has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version.
#dashboards.snapshot_url

# In case the archive contains the dashboards from multiple Beats, this lets you
# select which one to load. You can load all the dashboards in the archive by
# setting this to the empty string.
#dashboards.beat: filebeat

# The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. Default is ".kibana"
#dashboards.kibana_index: .kibana

# The Elasticsearch index name. This overwrites the index name defined in the
# dashboards and index pattern. Example: testbeat-*
#dashboards.index:

#================================ Logging ======================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, filebeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
logging.to_files: true
logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  #path: /var/log/filebeat

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
  #name: filebeat

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated
  rotateeverybytes: 10485760

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
  keepfiles: 10
